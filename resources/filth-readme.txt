Some textures, specifically the Threadplate textures and the striped warning textures, were created using base textures from Yves "Evillair" Allaire's e8 textures that are released under the GPL. Some were also created using base textures from my Babel texture pack, which uses photo references from CGtextures.com 

Some source textures are copyrighted by CGTextures.com. Permission to use these specific textures under the GPL license has been granted to to the author of this texture pack. Textures downloaded from CGTextures.com DO NOT fall under the GPL license by default.

If you wish to use these textures under a license other than the GPL or CC-by-SA, please contact me.

Enjoy :)
